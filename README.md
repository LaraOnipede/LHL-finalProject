# LHL-finalProject

# project Topic: Data Driven analysis and student performance prediction

**Project Description**
Project aims to analyze student performance patterns using demographic data, Virtual Learning Environment interactions, and assessments. Employing machine learning techniques such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM, the project predicts student performance. Insights derived will inform strategies to enhance educational outcomes and support personalized and virtual learning experiences.

**Project Goals and Objectives**
- Analyse Student Information and performance
- Predict Student result( Distinction, Pass, Fail, Withdrawn)
